              An online voting system is a digital platform that allows voters
              to cast their votes via the internet. Key features include secure
              user authentication, user-friendly ballot design, strong security
              measures (like encryption), accessibility for all voters,
              real-time results, and audit trails for verification. This system
              aims to increase voter participation, streamline the voting
              process, and ensure the integrity of elections.

            <p class="description">
              The offline voting system serves as a foundational element of
              democratic participation, enabling voters to cast their ballots in
              person at designated polling places. This method fosters a direct
              connection between citizens and the electoral process, promoting
              transparency and accountability. While offline voting is generally
              seen as secure, it does come with logistical challenges, such as
              the need for proper staffing, accessibility considerations, and
              the potential for long wait times on election day. Overall,
              despite the rise of digital alternatives, offline voting remains a
              vital mechanism for ensuring that every vote is counted and that
              the democratic process is upheld.
